    <h2>Description</h2>
    <a>This is the most delicious soup you will every try.</a>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
            <li>Fresh Onions</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>½ butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes</li> 
            <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>½ cube chicken bouillon</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground allipice</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat; cook the onion, garlic, and thyme in the hot butter until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Add the squash and chicken stock; bring to a simmer and cook until the squash is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Crumble the bouillon into the soup; season with cumin, allspice, salt, and pepper; remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway. Hold the lid of the blender in place with a kitchen towel and carefully start the blender using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a serving bowl. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup in the pot.</li> 
            
        </ol>
